# Image_classifier_webapp

In this application I want to build an image classifier

It is a real time app that opens your camera and classifies information based on real time images the camera takes.

Press a button and add an image: -- later when the same image shows up the camera will show the name of the button that you pressed.

Pretty neat!

I am still improving it and its applications are diverse.
